# Dart YTMusicAPI

_ytmusicapi_dart_ is a Dart library to send requests to the YouTube Music API. It emulates YouTube Music web client requests.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Dart YTMusicAPI is currently in early development.
> It is not yet feature-complete and may be unstable.
> We highly recommend wrapping most API calls in a `try-catch` block to prevent unexpected crashes or runtime errors.

## Getting started

Add this to your pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:
  ytmusicapi_dart: ^2.0.0
```

Or run this command:

```sh
dart pub add ytmusicapi_dart
```

It is possible that YouTube restricts the access to the API after some time. If that happens, you will get an error message. Try again later.

## Usage

```dart
import 'package:ytmusicapi_dart/ytmusicapi_dart.dart';

Future<void> main() async {
  final ytmusic = await YTMusic.create();
  final results = await ytmusic.search('search term');
  print(results);
  ytmusic.close();
}
```

More examples can be found in the [example folder](/example/).

## Additional information

This package is highly inspired by and ported to Dart from [sigma67's ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi), which is licensed under the MIT license, just like this package.
For additional information, check [the repository](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi).
For now, this package is only a port of it so I will not add new features that are not part of [sigma67's ytmusicapi](https://github.com/sigma67/ytmusicapi).
If you want to help (I would appreciate it), implement more functionality from there or fix bugs listed in [the todo file](/TODO.md) or the _issues_ section and open a PR here.

Thanks to [sigma67](https://github.com/sigma67) for the great work!
